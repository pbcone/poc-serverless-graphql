Finished Delivering Happiness:

I would say that the biggest takeaway is the following: 

We tend to focus on how much money a particular field or career will lead to. At the end of the day, the pursuit of money will not leave us filled with happiness or satisfaction. It also wont enhance the relationships that we have with our teammates or customers. 

We should strive to build relationships and find purpose. We should strive to build a culture that is worth spending time in--one that is exciting, joyful, comfortable, and happy. If we create a culture that is loved, employees will enjoy their work, and they will reciprocate that enjoyment, and love, to the customers. ",,jaucoin@cbtnuggets.com,

9:00 AM - 10 AM speakers: 
 Keynote1 - John Green, Co-Creator of Vlogbrothers

Think about things other than metrics when evaluating growth and impact of video content
Too many people only focus on getting that “viral video”
But sometimes that can really hurt your video and brand
As views go up, so do ratio of dislikes and haters
Get an awesome audience, not a huge one.

Keynote 2 - Hank Green, Co-Creator of Vlogbrothers

youtube has gotten to the point where its a lot like television - there are a number of shows that have large enough audiences that they take a majority of the traffic from youtube. Its unrealistic to put a show on youtube and expect to make a living with it. It has to compete with the big dogs and thats an incredibly difficult thing to do now. The golden days are over. Now its back to a “little guy trying to take on the big dog” rather than the big equal opportunity society it used to be several years ago.


Mike Vorhaus - Magid Advisors
An overview of statistics concerning the online video industry.

We need to wrap our heads around the fact that a smart phone is a tv now
50% of people are watching video on a smart phone at least once a day - including millenials.
To many execs bury their heads in the sand about how much content is really on youtube.
As a whole, companies need to shrink budgets on their videos, as free distribution is becoming key.
Thoughts of “cord-cutting” on the rise as people stream content rather than use cable services
Like it or not.. Snapchat has become a MAJOR social platform for video distribution
Virtual Reality will be big for those wanting engaging training experiences and for those creating training content",,sbarth@cbtnuggets.com,

Not a lot from this presentation applied to my day-to-day. Stuff we as a company are already doing through our NuggetLove program.. which Kuddos to us that we are doing that. These guys are pushing for companies to take this mentality and we are already doing it.

Michael Sprague - Kia motors - Chief storyteller
How to build engagement when attentions spans continue to go down
Building “Micro-Moments” - Little video snippets that solve problems or provide specific answers - 15 seconds of “How does my sun roof work?”
Videos must be short, get information out quickly, but also maintain balance of entertainment so people will continue to watch and look for more
Give people things they don’t expect to see - everyone expects cars driving around in car commercials.. they are so used to it they can tune it out, but no one expects to see hamsters.
Look at the audience right now - they are not listening to us, their heads are down looking at their phones. Whether you agree with that or not, take advantage of that and give people your content to engage in.
Luxury audiences tend to look for more video support of their product. It helps sell the message of Luxury over competitors. Ease of use, sharing of info.
Cats are the secret of success :)
They feel VR is going to be HUGE for the market, but as marketers they are still trying to wrap their heads around how to use it and what do it with it that makes sense for the brand.

Jens Christensen - President of Jaunt VR
Differences between VR and AR and mixed-reality
smart phones are not the best VR experience, but key in getting VR content out there due to numbers
Too many people treat VR with the same mind-set as 2D films, with action taking place in front of you and not much else surrounding you.
ITs like early days of film where they had to figure out the right mix of close-up versus wide shots.
The internet is all about information. VR is all about experiences - something unlike anything else available
Still a few years out from VR really being a main stream part of our lives",,sbarth@cbtnuggets.com,6/23/2016 10:00:00

Ricky Van Vleen - College Humor Founder
It’s better to not post anything than post a bad video. That will hurt your marketing efforts for a long time and make it hard to bring the audience back

Mike Sepso - Activision Blizzard
Create a tune-in habit - get people to come check on you everyday. Like the habit people have of coming home from work and automatically turn on ESPN to check for sports updates.
Find creative ways to connect your videos with your target audiences
These guys have figured out to change their world so that video games can now become a competitive sport. Find ways to rethink your distribution to take it from where it is to someplace where it can be new and effective for your audience.
Now taking the platform and evolving it from a computer experience to a set-top, traditional TV box environment through Roku, Apple TV or methods that take it into the regular living room and away from computer.

Fidji Simo
Director of Product - Facebook/Facebook Live
Facebook Live - Be authentic - its a true way to connect with your audience with key ways to interact. 
Easy tools built in to tell your followers when you are live. Easy sharing mechanism 
Helps creators get discovered
Trying to find some way to monetize creators to pay them back when reaching large audiences.
Live videos tend to run longer. People go into them expecting a longer length than traditional video.
Just go into it with an “experimental attitude”. Figure out how to make it work best for you
People appreciate the combination of legit news and added personality so they feel like they get to know you and who you are. Builds connections.

2 - 2:30 Creating Compelling Narrative for VR

Look for editing plugins coming out for FCPX so editing techniques can be incorporated into regular workflow
Watch how you stage scenes, don’t rely on 2d film mindset
Find the proper balance for length of shots. Those not used to VR will need time to adapt to their environment before jumping to a new scene. Those used to the experience may get impatient if scenes are paced too long. Figure out who the video is targeted to and adjust from there.
Don’t assume the “middle of the action” is the right place for the camera. No one has a discussion in the middle of 4 people. It makes it really awkward and removes the audience from the reality of the simulation.
The Matel kids designed view master vr is the best. less than $20 at Bestbuy. 


2:30 - 3:00: Creating and deploying tens of thousands of personalized videos (#dovideo)
Video is key, regardless of the platform its released on. Every social platform has a way to distribute video content
new video is needed on a daily basis. People watch a video once, maybe twice if its really good, then they move on. So you need multiple, almost daily short video to keep the audience engaged and your brand in their minds.
Have personality and authenticity
The sources of creating video (and video footage) have multiplied. find ways to use it and vary its usage (It’s ok to use animated gifs)
***Ideas for CBT Marketing: Shorter videos from trainers. One question, one trainer answer, release daily on social. short short short. A little 30 second video each day to increase audience engagement, serve was training reminders, etc. Take the “Ask a trainer” series. Take those videos (already shot) and break them down into little pieces to put out on social. But add in a mix of fun, like last years gif shoot stuff. Use those videos in social efforts.

Jeff Siebert - Head of consumer products at Twitter
Hanna …Girl Exec from Vine
SSB note - Previous session got out late, missed first half of this one. Look it up when released with show archive
Vine is changing distribution (announced this week). Keeping 6 second video that can be clicked to view up to 140 second full content. Users can keep with the short form (trailer metaphor) or dive deeper on videos that interest them (full movie metaphor)
Twitter and Vine media partnership (key combo for short attention span world)

Brian Robbins, CEO of AwesomenessTV
started as a basic youtube channel 4 years ago. Now a full fledged media company.
Live in an age where youtube hits are harder and harder to come by.
Successful videos MUST start with quality storytelling.
Doesn’t matter about production values, or any aspect of video production, if there is no TALENT for an audience to grasp and connect to, nothing will happen. There must be video talent to succeed.
They have become a content machine - over 800 hours of premium content in just 4 years, producing 8 films this year, a netflix series, a Hulu series. Film produced and sold at Cannes for theatrical distribution. All from a youtube channel in 4 years. Make content, let it grow.
Find what works best for each platform and target your content to that platform. What do we get from the Facebook audience vs the Twitter audience vs. the youtube audience and do specific media for that platform. Don’t just make one piece of content and attempt to distribute over all networks.
Great managers don’t meddle in the day to day processes. They are there as a resource when needed, but let their people use their talent and make great media. His partner - Jeffry Katzenberg, who used that philosophy

Where do we go from here: Full panel of multiple guests

Future move to one social channel? No. People use different social media channels to fragment themselves and their media. Facebook may be their connection to family and friends. Twitter is for wide audience thoughts or contacts related to a specific business. So audiences are resistant to everything combined into one solution. Multiple solutions still work.
Viral videos can hurt as it sets a precedent for audience reaction that can likely never be topped. One video goes viral, then the rest can’t top it or measure up in comparison of numbers, and many business owners may see that as a failure, but its really not. Still compelling video that being falsely judged and compared. 
95% of video is fan to fan creation. Too many companies don’t recognize this and as such can miss out on so much content. Our fans are talking and creating, are we recognizing them and their passion?
Interesting note - lots of people love the show Modern Family, but are there thousands of screaming Modern Family fans swarming the first floor like there are youtube content creator fans right now? Youtube fans can be rabid content ambassadors if we use them.
Panel observation: In the expo downstairs, place is PACKED, but 3 booths feel empty: Nickelodeon, Netflix, and Youtube Red. Why are they struggling to connect with their audiences at this level?
Many of the youtube content creators downstairs have larger audiences and bigger reach then major cable networks included in typical cable bundles. We have to unbundle. Cable companies using an outdated business model
MARKET to your audience, don’t advertise to your audience. People tune out the ads.

Panel of speakers

Discussion on studies of impact of video super fans on branding efforts
Content Creators are no longer considered to be unreachable or above the fans. Fans can now connect one on one on a personal level with the content creators they connect with, making strong content communities
One panelist called them “Supporters” rather than fan, as he considers it a big support group.
Take advantage of your brand ambassadors
Fans now have power
Make events to REALLY spoil your super fans. Go above and beyond to further encourage them as evangelists. Last year at Walking Dead panel at comic con, this fans not only got to go to the panel, they got to see the season premier, they got special access to behind the scenes experiences. Those fans came out of the experience on fire and telling the world. Use that. Same goes for the Star Wars Comic Con experience rewarding the fans with a surprise concert after their panel.
When there is backlash, address it with the fans. Listen to what they are saying and then then incorporate them into the decision and change process so they feel heard, valued and part of the community.
Don’t ignore the negative comments, use them to help you improve. But also realize that some people will complain and be haters regardless.
Hey wow.. panelist Peter Hollins, is from Eugene.. lives downtown!  https://www.youtube.com/user/peterhollens. 1.3 million subscribers on youtube. Will have to pick his brain.
People get an emotional feeling of ownership. There can be conflict between real ownership and emotional ownership from fans.
Use fans for content creation - showcase fans, again.. make them feel connected to your brand.

Copyright Laws - Navigating potential liability for content owners
Fair Use laws are confusing and not all automated check systems on platforms like youtube will know what’s fair use.
Factors of fair use, but its always tricky: “Is the new work transformative?” and that word can be confusing!
Questions to ask: Is my including this content snippet making it so that the audience doesn’t need to reference the original work where the copyright is held? Take Chewbacca mom for example. Are you including so much of that clip that people get the point and don’t have to go check out the original.


Balancing Education and Entertainment in Video Content
VR usage - There needs to be a reason for why a video is done in VR versus a traditional video
Question actually raised: how do we turn a white board training video into a TV experience. Is there a way or reason to do that. We just don’t know what that future is yet.
Grumpy presenter guy - “360 is ridiculous. if you want a simulation of the real world.. go to the real world!!” :)
“In the real world.. how many times do you take the time to look behind you!! You don’t because you face forward.”
Panel giving this guy crap for being a tech curmudgeon 
3d is a similar situation - Is it being done for a purpose, or is it being done as a gimmick to make more $
Idea as presented from audience member -Use VR to help teach people to discover things for themselves, rather than traditional media where you tell them what they should be looking at.
Just create the content and viewers will provide feedback as to what works and what doesn't. 
Keep it unexpected. Not a lot of gaps on youtube.

Transforming Education with Online Video
Tricks with online “educational” video - who is fact checking these things? How do you know that the video you are rely on for education is actually correct?
Audience is best source of fact checking, but if you screw up too many times you will lose your credibility as an online educator
Educational video has gone a long way. 10 years ago, teacher would roll in tv and play a vhs tape approved by some educational company. Today, millions of options you can tailer to your students.. or you can create your own video and craft what works for you and your students

New business models for online video

Don't bank on google or you tubes algorithm. It will change and it could leave you in the dust.
Could go with a subscription model, but can scare people off. When people are used to receiving something for free, there will be pushback. Super fans who devour your content will go along, but you may lose the rest.
Audiences are getting overwhelmed by all the choices they have to make.
For subscription model look at loucrate
Advice- manage your expectations. Success on YouTube is a 24/7 work your butt off when you may not see the success you think you'll have.
Must be passionate otherwise this is the wrong business
Really harness your data, and ip
No one knows what metrics matter or what metrics dictate success. Everyone is looking for some different numbers to determine ROI. Video is the hardest to determine ROI between all the networks and methods.

Things don't have to be real or expensive. Just enough to fake it. Pencil can - not real. Piece of paper rolled with pencils inside. Looked legit but if poked would fall over and be destroyed.
Hang fabric on walls - cheap and adsorbs sound
Don't need a lot of space. Some sets are tiny!
Take photos of blank walls and mockup in Photoshop to test looks before spending money.

Available security methods include: 
Security Groups which segment hosts from other hosts
Virtual Private Cloud and Access Control Lists which define rules for incoming and outgoing traffic by ip addresses, ports, and protocols. 
Direct Connect allows the direct connection to another external private data center. 
Import and Export allows for the import and export of data via physical media by shiping it to and from the AWS datacenter
VPNs, AWS allows users to connect to hosts through vpns
Dedicated Server, users can purchase dedicated hardware which will then be reserved just for them. Useful for elite compliance models

The video also covered Identity and Access Management (IAM), which dictates access to AWS resources. It can use multi-factor authentication.And allows for API access with ID and Key
